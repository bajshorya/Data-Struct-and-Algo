Heaps
-Complete Binary tree
-Every node value >= all of its children
-stored in array ,but represented as a tree
-parent of every index i =i/2 (integer)
-left of parent (i)= i*2
-right of parent (i)= i*2+1
-no pointers required because of these formulas
-height = log(N)

insertion time complex=O(log(N))
deletion = O(log(N))
